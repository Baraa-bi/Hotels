  ## In this app i had used Spring framework ... simply because  i love Java :P

  In this application i just had consumed the provieded api and present it data with a readable way 
  after that i had used some of its filters like destination name , length of stay , min and max trip start date 
  so you can search and get different responses  
  
  I had write some comments for the things that might be not clear
  
  
  hope you enjoy the app :)
